16 march 2018 (updation in fields and details and database)
Tasks and Process

 task 1:
solve the sidebar issues ..now after pushing it will show (may i help u,send buyers requirement etc)

2: make new form of i.e. enquiry form according to sheet(in Footer.php)
3: databse design i.e. update table enquiry add fields same as shown in image which i have 
     pushed named as enquiry.png  (Fileds start from "enq_quantity"--> to  -->"enq_Requirement_purchase")

4: backend code is in send-enquiry.php
     Important :: global.php is reference file for form  in the sense whole dependency of enquiry form 
      is on global.php coz i have made arrays of all radio options in global.php 
        if whole global.php is pushed and if code is not working or crashed then quickely revert file 
       and "just add below code in global.php In short no need to replace all file".
     

//Enquiry form

$enq_supplier_location=array("Local","Anywhere India","Outide India");

$enq_Requirement_urgency=array("Immidiate","After one month");
